## Why?

**Storing data** is a ***necessity*** for *all* (but the *simplest*) web applications. &nbsp;

*Often* ***accessing*** that data *can be* the ***biggest bottleneck***
in an app causing it to be ***slow and painful experience***. :hourglass: :zzz: :cry:  
**Redis** is ***designed*** to be the ***fastest*** way to store and retrieve data. :rocket:  
Which means **less waiting** for the people using your app! :clap: :grinning:
